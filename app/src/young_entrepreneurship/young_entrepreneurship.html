					<h2 class="textHeader">Background on Young Entrepreneurs</h2>
					<p class="text">They're the “millennipreneurs,” as a new survey puts it, and at just 20 to 35 years old, they're starting more companies, managing bigger staffs, and targeting higher profits than their baby boomer predecessors. Those findings come from the 2016 BNP Paribas Global Entrepreneur Report. According to the findings, millennials are discovering entrepreneurship significantly earlier than boomers did. While the older generation launched their first businesses at roughly 35 years old, so-called “millennipreneurs” are setting out around 27—which means some of them already have almost a decade of experience. “The trend we have noticed is that you can succeed earlier,” Frank says. “Before, you needed to be 40 or 50. Then it was 30 to 40. Now it’s 20 to 30. This is a trend which is obvious everywhere. Of course it’s linked to the new technologies, but it’s also a change in the world, which [now] accepts that you can be the CEO of a big company or own your own company at a young age.” Millennials are starting more businesses, too. The report found that they’ve launched about twice as many as boomers have—nearly eight companies each versus three to four for boomers. Second, millennials may be more open to failure than boomers are. “Before, failure was considered a stop in your career,” he adds. “Today, you can easily fail” and keep going. “We don’t know if all the 7.7 companies [millennials] have created are successful.” Young entrepreneurs are leading larger teams, too—staffs of about 122 people, compared to boomers’ 30. That’s partly because of the sectors they’re working in, according to the report. While still making money in the boomer-preferred professional services sectors (accountancy, law, consulting), millennials were also focused on retail, technology, investment management and e-commerce, which tend to require larger staffs. Millennials are also eyeing larger gross profit margins. According to the report, almost 75% expected their profits to increase in the coming year. For boomers, it was 42%. That means young entrepreneurs are more bullish than the 50+ crowd, the report says.BNP’s report found that millennials have a different view of social responsibility, too. Frank says that while entrepreneurs traditionally built their businesses and wealth first and considered philanthropy later, “millennipreneurs” are thinking about their social impact early on. These young business owners vary in age range and in profession. From the list above the youngest CEO’s are Andy Sartori and Massimo...</p>
