					<h2 class="textHeader">Young Fitness Entrepreneurs List</h2>
					<p class="text">Fitness entrepreneurs are serial entrepreneurs, tech ceo’s and other business owners that get behind a product that has a fitness affinity. Some sports entrepreneurs have a product that revolves around food for fitness like protein powder, power bars or fitness meal prep. So who are some of these sports entrepreneurs? Here is a fitness entrepreneurs list:</p><br>
					<p class="text"><b>1. Sara Moylan, founder of Shefit</b> The Shefit Ultimate Sports Bra. The only adjustable sports bra on the market, it features a 10” Velcro band you can adjust around the rib cage to give support from beneath, as well as adjustable straps to give the right amount of lift. As far as future plans for the brand, Moylan’s goals are bold. “I plan to take over the women’s athleticwear industry with products that support women in all walks of life,” she says. “Whether her goal is to run her 100th marathon or to walk around the block for the first time, I want women to be confident that Shefit is there to support their goals. In the meantime, I’ve got plans to introduce three or four additional products built on our adjustable fit technology in the next 12 to 24 months. I also have a few ideas for better fitting, better performing pants, shorts, track jackets…so many things!”</p><br>
					<p class="text"><b>2. Chavonne Hodges, founder of Trap Aerobics</b> A solid track list is a must-have for any successful workout class. But until Trap Aerobics hit the workout scene last spring, there was no workout dedicated to tapping into the distinct beats of Trap music, and pairing it with a routine. “There were a few core inspirations for Trap Aerobics, says Hodges. “The lack of resources for people of color who struggle with mental illness (and the fact that exercise serves as a natural and free alternative to antidepressants) being one; my love of working out to trap music, and my co-instructor, Fiona Harvey’s passion for public health.”</p><br>
					<p class="text"><b>3. Stacy Schwartz, founder of Ketanga</b> Fitness retreats are having a moment. Looking to head to an island for a week of yoga poses and morning meditation? There’s a trip for that. Wanderlusting for a more active destination that takes you on challenging hikes through scenic mountains? Done. But if you don’t fall into the outdoorsy hike or yoga on the beach type of workout category, you’re going to have a hard time finding a trip for say, boxing or HIIT. Schwartz noticed the need for more diverse offerings in the space, and created a company to help fill in the gap. “Yoga retreats have dominated the wellness tourism industry for years,” she says. “But what Ketanga does differently is focus less on a narrow type of fitness and more on the compelling themes, or fitness/wellness professionals who have something unique to share and offer.”</p><br>
					<p class="text"><b>4. Emily Cook Harris, founder of Empowered</b>, empowered designs personalized programs based on interests, fitness level and goals, and offers one on one coaching along the way to keep clients on track. “It began as a side hustle with one client, then two, then three, and now full-time,” Cook says. “I’ve recently relocated to L.A. to expand our personal training and lifestyle coaching program.” Future plans include expanding the brand’s digital offerings to help more clients using EMPOWERED’s unique approach. “It ultimately comes down to wanting to help as many people as possible harness the power of health and fitness to be their best and transform their lives,” says Cook. “So we are exploring options within that realm to share our empowered ways.”</p><br>
					<p class="text"><b>5. Andy Sartori, founder of MealPro</b>, MealPro is an online fitness food delivery serivce that sells only on the web. The company specializes in fitness food delivered to athletes. All meals are pre-portioned and pre-cooked and are made by expert chefs and professional athletes.</p>
