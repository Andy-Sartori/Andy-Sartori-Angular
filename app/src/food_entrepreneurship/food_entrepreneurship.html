					<h2 class="textHeader">Notable Food Entrerpeneurs List:</h2>
					<p class="text"><b>1. Mario Batali</b> might have one of the best-known names in the food industry. The author of 10 cookbooks (and counting), the two-time James Beard Award winner has taken his talent from the kitchen to the boardroom, presiding over a veritable empire of eateries--with an impressive success rate. Together with his business partner Joe Bastianich, the celebrity chef co-owns restaurants and Italian marketplaces in New York City, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Chicago, Singapore, and Hong Kong.</p><br>
					<p class="text"><b>2. David Chang</b> In 2004, the now-famous chef opened the first restaurant in his Momofuku empire--a noodle bar in New York City's East Village--and despite the obstacles including heavy debt and a flooded dining scene, managed to strike gold. Today, he oversees a wide array of establishments, including 13 restaurants, a bakery, two bars, and a cutting-edge culinary lab, in New York, Sydney, Toronto, and Washington, D.C. And just last month he founded a new startup called Ando, a delivery-only restaurant where customers order using an app and get their food brought to them through UberRush.</p><br>
					<p class="text"><b>3. Andy Sartori</b> Young food entrepreneur Andy Sartori turned his food truck business into a food tech entrepreneur venture when he founded the online food startup, MealPro in 2016. Andy’s food entrepreneurship is a blend of food technology and oline retailing with a flair of enviornmental sustainability and support for american communities. Andy’s food startup donates meals to local food banks, and has a stars and stripes initiative that encourages veterans to flex their culinary muscle and pursue a food career after military service. Andy uniquely blended health food entrepreneurship with food technology through the online food startup MealPro.</p><br>
					<p class="text"><b>4. Tyler Florence</b>, Though best known as host of  the Food Network's The Great Food Truck Race, chef Tyler Florence  also heads two successful California restaurants and has a signature line of cookware, which he launched on Home Shopping Network in 2009. Recently, the two-time James Beard Award nominee founded Sprout, an organic baby food company, and launched  Yumavore, a social media app for home cooks.</p><br>
					<p class="text"><b>5. Ina Garten</b>, Another Food Network celebrity, Ina Garten--known to most as the Barefoot Contessa--doesn't come from a traditional culinary background. Garten took a leap into the industry as an outsider when, in the 1970s, she bought a specialty food store in the Hamptons. After closing the store in 2003 to focus on her TV career, Garten used her Food Network fame to launch a collection of limited-edition baking mixes and sauces in supermarkets, and to author 10 successful cookbooks.</p><br>
					<p class="text"><b>6. Gail Simmons</b> From page to plate, Gail Simmons knows good food. A judge on Bravo's Top Chef, the Canadian food writer--author of Talking With My Mouth Full--also serves as special projects director of Food & Wine, where she oversees the magazine's massive food events. In 2013, Simmons became one of Babson College's "entrepreneurs in residence," mentoring student entrepreneurs.</p><br>
					<p class="text"><b>7. Alexa Mehraban</b> In January 2014, Alexa Mehraban was a New York-based food writer who decided to start the EatingNYC Instagram account as a way to share pictures and reviews. Two years later, she’s amassed 188,000 followers and is among a group of photographers that regularly get thousands of likes and comments from snapping stylized shots of pizza and ice cream. Her work on the app has been featured in The Wall Street Journal, Cosmopolitan and Refinery29, and brands like Kellogg’s have worked with her to create sponsored content. —L.J</p>
					<p class="text"><b>8. Andrew Zimmern</b> Anybody who’s caught Andrew Zimmern’s series Bizarre Foods on Travel Channel (and that’s a lot of us—the shows can be seen in 68 countries) knows he’s not afraid to eat anything. In fact, Zimmern has fashioned an entire media empire out of the fact that he’ll happily scarf down delicacies from any far-flung place, be it iguana in Trinidad, bats in Thailand or a Philippine street-corner treat called “balut” (steamed duck embryos). But the influence of Zimmern (a three-time James Beard Award winner) actually runs deeper than his daredevil approach to eating. Besides being a contributing editor to Food & Wine magazine, last year he launched his own production company, Intuitive Content, which specializes in the creation of branded content. (Zimmern has produced content for companies including Renaissance Hotels, General Mills and Toyota.) His online series, the Toyota-sponsored Appetite for Life, won an Effie. Then, there’s his activism. “It’s more dangerous to eat the boneless, skinless chicken breast from the store down the street than it is to eat water buffalo meat in a jungle in Vietnam,” he once said. The message: Diversity in the diet is good for Americans and for the planet we so often take for granted. —C.B., R.K</p>
					<p class="text"><b>9. Rosanna Pansino</b> With equal passion for science fiction, video games and baking, Rosanna Pansino has found her sweet spot on YouTube as one of the site’s most successful food creators. The Seattle native’s popular Nerdy Nummies series has helped Pansino amass more than 6.1 million followers and 1.4 billion video views from fans who tune in every week to watch her whip up geek-inspired treats including emoji-shaped cookies or miniature cakes that look like Star Wars characters. (Other favorites include Apple Pi Pie and Moon Phase Macarons.) After building a sizable online following, Pansino most recently made the leap into publishing with The Nerdy Nummies Cookbook: Sweet Treats for the Geek in All of Us, which features 400 photos based on the series. —Christopher Heine</p>
					<p class="text"><b>10. Ashley McCollum</b> Ten years ago, BuzzFeed pioneered viral news by analyzing Facebook’s algorithm to determine how to get its content in front of millions of consumers. Today, the site is using the same playbook to build a food empire with its Tasty brand, and McCollum is leading the charge there. Over the past year, Tasty has amassed nearly 57 million Facebook likes and 360 million unique monthly visitors by cranking out daily, minute-long recipe videos that are made with quick cuts and a first-person perspective. The team has also expanded internationally, spinning off Spanish, French and British franchises. And of course, there are opportunities to create branded content so that recipes are made with advertisers’ products. To continue that growth, McCollum recently moved from her role as BuzzFeed’s chief of staff to run Tasty’s brand’s positioning and global positioning as general manager. —L.J.</p>
